    Welcome to the help! It describes the various functionality of the app and how the Lamp "should"
    react to it.
</p>

<h3>Enable SLamp Switch</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Turns on the Lamp</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The colour will be what the mixer currently shows</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Will automatically toggle "ON" when some other functions are utilised</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<p>

<h3>Daylight Alarm Switch</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Will notify the Lamp to automatically turn on 30min before your next phone alarm</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Reads the value of the <b>next</b> upcoming alarm. Make sure your next alarm is correct!
        Just toggle the switch again or use the Sync Alarms Button to update the alarm time</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>The colour will be what the mixer currently shows. Be prepared to wake up to blood red if
            you don't change it!</p>
    </li>
</ul>


<p>

<h3>Sync Alarms Button</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Reads the value of the <b>next</b> upcoming alarm and sends it to the Lamp</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Useful if you change the alarm on your phone and the Daylight Alarm Switch is already set</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>It is mostly there to look cool...</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Daylight Color Switch</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Sets the colour to some RGB value vaguely representing sunlight</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Leave this "ON" after switching the Daylight Alarm to wake up the warm glow of artificial
            sunlight. mmm warm...</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Will automatically toggle off when you change the colour</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Party Mode Switch</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Who knows what this one will do??</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <p>Well it should put the Lamp into a mode where it randomly sets the colour at short random
            intervals of time and maybe even randomly turns on and off smooth transitions. No
            guarantees on anything with this one. </p>
    </li>
</ul>


<p>

<h3>Colour Mixer</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>sixteen million possibilities</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>

<h3>Colour Picker</h3>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>sixteen million, seven hundred and seventy seven thousand, two hundred and sixteen possibilities</p>
    </li>
</ul>
